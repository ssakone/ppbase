Jobs scheduling

If you have tasks that need to be performed periodically, you could set up crontab-like jobs with the builtin `app.Cron()` _(it returns an app scoped [`cron.Cron`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/cron#Cron) value)_ .

The jobs scheduler is started automatically on app `serve`, so all you have to do is register a handler with [`app.Cron().Add(id, cronExpr, handler)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/cron#Cron.Add) or [`app.Cron().MustAdd(id, cronExpr, handler)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/cron#Cron.MustAdd) (_the latter panic if the cron expression is not valid_).

Each scheduled job runs in its own goroutine and must have:

-   **id** - identifier for the scheduled job; could be used to replace or remove an existing job
-   **cron expression** - e.g. `0 0 * * *` ( _supports numeric list, steps, ranges or macros_ )
-   **handler** - the function that will be executed every time when the job runs

Here is one minimal example:

`// main.go package main import ( "log" "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase" ) func main() { app := pocketbase.New() // prints "Hello!" every 2 minutes app.Cron().MustAdd("hello", "*/2 * * * *", func() { log.Println("Hello!") }) if err := app.Start(); err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } }`

To remove already registered cron job you can call [`app.Cron().Remove(id)`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/tools/cron#Cron.Remove)

All registered app level cron jobs can be also previewed and triggered from the _Dashboard > Settings > Crons_ section.

Keep in mind that the `app.Cron()` is also used for running the system scheduled jobs like the logs cleanup or auto backups (the jobs id is in the format `__pb*__`) and replacing these system jobs or calling `RemoveAll()`/`Stop()` could have unintended side-effects.

If you want more advanced control you can initialize your own cron instance independent from the application via `cron.New()`.
